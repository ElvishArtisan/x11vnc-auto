This is the INSTALL file for the x11vnc-auto package.

X11vnc-auto implements a service for providing automated VNC access to the
local X11 display (:0). See README for more information.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your
system before building x11vnc-auto:

Qt6 Toolkit, development toolkit, v6.2.4 or higher. See
https://www.qt.io/product/qt6

libvncserver, cross platform library for implementing VNC servers. See
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxtst

libXtst, X11 Record extension library. See
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libxtst

Building the Package
--------------------
Once the prereequites have been installed, the package can be built by means
of the following commands:

./configure
make
make install

Enabling the Service
--------------------
1) Set the VNC password by opening a shell for user 'rd' and doing:

   vncpasswd

2) Start the service by opening a shell for user 'root' and doing:

   systemctl start x11vnc-auto.socket
   systemctl enable x11vnc-auto.socket

Enabling the Desktop Plugin
---------------------------
1) Add an instance of the 'genmon' plugin to the XFCE4 panel.

2) Right-click on the plug-in on the Panel and select 'Properties'.

3) Enter the following into the 'Command' field and then touch 'Save':
'/home/rd/.vnc/xfce4-genmon.sh'.

Due to a bug in the Ubuntu 'qt6-base-dev-tools', it may be necessary to
define the following environmental variable to allow Qt's moc(1) utility
to be found by the build system:

  QT6_MOC=/usr/lib/qt6/libexec/moc
