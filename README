This is the README file for the x11vnc-auto package.

This implements a pair of systemd services for providing an automatic
VNC login to view the running :0 display on a RHEL 7 system.

To enable the service:

1) Set the VNC password by opening a shell for user 'rd' and doing:

   vncpasswd

2) Start the service by opening a shell for user 'root' and doing:

   systemctl start x11vnc-auto
   systemctl enable x11vnc-auto
